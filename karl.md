# Karl's notes

* ~~entering a guess crashes if input is not numeric~~
* ~~allows you to guess out of range~~
* doesnt check for repeat guesses
* ~~entering a name only uses the first word (doesn't catch spaces)~~

# My own notes

* Add methods
* Add the "Freezing", "Cold", "Warm", "Hot" hints
* ~~try/catch for invalid guess?~~
